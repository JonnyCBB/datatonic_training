# Datatonic training repo

This repository contains toy models that the [News UK](https://www.news.co.uk/) data science team are going to use during training with [Datatonic](http://datatonic.com/).

It contains an ANN model written in Keras to predict churn on a toy dataset. It also contains an entity scoring algorithm that takes a body of text and scores each entity found by [Google NLP API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) according to it's relevance to the text.

**NOTE:** these models are effectively toy models and neither are in use by News UK.
